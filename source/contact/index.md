## Welcome Messages

I'm very responsive to inbound communications.
Please don't hesitate to reach out.

### Topics I Am Excited To Talk about

* Feedback on my blog or code
* Success stories (or other postmortems) from folks who use my code
  * If you use or fork my project, I'd love to hear what you're up to!
* Technical discussions regarding topics I've expressed interest in
* Consulting opportunities

### Messages That Will Be Ignored

* Third-party or otherwise impersonal recruiters
* Non-technical founders seeking a CTO

## Feedback Channels

### Email

Don't hesitate to email [blog@brandonbloom.name](mailto:blog@brandonbloom.name)
if you have a question or want to communicate in more depth about any of the
topics here on my site. I'm always happy to talk with practitioners and
students alike.

### GitHub

Issues and Pull Requests are welcome on all of [my Github projects][1].
This includes typo and other corrections for [my blog's source code][2].

If you wish to make a larger contribution, it's a good idea to email me first.
I'd appreciate the opportunity to help you make the largest possible impact.

### Twitter

My Twitter handle is [@BrandonBloom][3].

Twitter is my preferred channel for love notes and hate mail. If you want to
have a technical discussion, email is preferable. If you're not sure, tweet at
me and make sure there is a way to contact you in your profile.

### Blog Comments

I don't allow comments on my blog. I've had significant issues with spam and
low quality feedback in the past. If you wish to make a quick public comment,
please [mention me on Twitter][4]. If you've arrived at my site via Reddit,
Hacker News, or another discussion site, feel free to comment there. I check
and investigate referrers on a regular basis.

### LinkedIn

Please do not expect to have a discussion with me via LinkedIn. I'll happily
accept connection requests from anyone I've interacted with, but I can't
promise I'll read messages there. Cold connection requests will be rejected.
