    <p>I work in an environment full of brilliant, technically minded people. Try as I might, sometimes I simply forget how little most people know about computers.</p>  <p>In IKEA, I saw a odd wire metal rack which mounted to the side of a desk and held a computer tower suspended off the ground. Why anyone would attach such an ugly thing to a desk is beyond me. What is wrong with the computer being four inches lower, on the ground?</p>  <p>Moments later, an young, female employee pointed to the tower rack and referred to it as a &quot;CPU holder&quot;. Never mind that she was actually trying to sell this silly thing to someone, she just called a car engine by the name of a fuel injector!</p>    </div>
