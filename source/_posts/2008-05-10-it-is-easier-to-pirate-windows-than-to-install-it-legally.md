    My desktop machine is totally hosed. I don't know why or what is wrong, but it is really bad. So I want to re-install Vista, but I can't find the DVD or product key.<br /><br />I currently own several Windows Vista licenses:<br /><ul><li>Gift for being a Vista beta tester</li><li>Drexel CS Department</li><li>From interning at Microsoft for a combined 9 months (and full-time this July)<br /></li><li>Microsoft Dreamspark</li><li>Probably more</li></ul>I expected to use my beta tester Ultimate license via logging into <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/">connect.microsoft.com</a>, downloading the DVD, and getting the product key from Connect as well. Unfortunately, I can't find the product key or download anywhere on the new Connect. Additionally, I'm blocked from all MSDN subscriber downloads because, well, I'm not a subscriber. Strangely enough, I vividly remember being able to download Vista from MSDN at one point...<br /><br />I'm looking high and low for a spot to download Windows Vista legally. It is <a href="http://www.mininova.org/search/windows+vista+ultimate/seeds">laughably easy to download it illegally</a>, and the download speed will be better than Microsoft's servers anyway.<br /><br />The next version of Windows should be freely available for download and the installer should ask for my Windows Live ID, not some cryptic 5x5 product key.  </div>
