A while ago, I started blogging again. Google's Blogger isn't great for code
snippets, so I contorted a few posts to fit the formatting. A few posts never
got written at all. I wanted to get my blog into Github Flavored Markdown and
under version control. I'm not a super huge fan of Jekyll, but in interest of
getting back to content, I went ahead and did the simplest possible thing that
could work. So here's my new blog. It's built on [Jekyll][1] via [Octopress][2]
with the a [Theme by Lucas Lew][3] and hosted on [GitHub Pages][4].
