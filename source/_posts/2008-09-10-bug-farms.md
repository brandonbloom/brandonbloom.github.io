    <p>I recently learnt a new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/tags/Microspeak/default.aspx">microspeak</a> phrase that I love: bug farm.</p>  <p>Some features are bug farms.</p>  <p>This means that these features are either poorly specified or highly unmaintainable. As a result, they produce a larger than average portion of the product's bugs. They can get into either state though a variety of ways, but by far the most common way is insufficient thought during design or implementation. Additionally, it is also possible to establish a bug farm by building a feature on top of an existing bug farm.</p>  <p>If you encounter a feature which is covered in larvae, you should spray it with insecticides immediately. It is better to use too much insecticide and kill the feature than it is to deliver an infested product to your customers. That is, if the bugs don't rise up and eat you before you get the chance to do either.</p>    </div>
