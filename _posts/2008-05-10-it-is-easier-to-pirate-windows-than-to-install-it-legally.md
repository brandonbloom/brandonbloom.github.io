My desktop machine is totally hosed. I don't know why or what is wrong, but it
is really bad. So I want to re-install Vista, but I can't find the DVD or
product key.

I currently own several Windows Vista licenses:

* Gift for being a Vista beta tester
* Drexel CS Department
* From interning at Microsoft for a combined 9 months (and full-time this July)
* Microsoft Dreamspark
* Probably more

I expected to use my beta tester Ultimate license via logging into
http://connect.microsoft.com/, downloading the DVD, and getting the product key
from Connect as well. Unfortunately, I can't find the product key or download
anywhere on the new Connect. Additionally, I'm blocked from all MSDN subscriber
downloads because, well, I'm not a subscriber.  Strangely enough, I vividly
remember being able to download Vista from MSDN at one point...

I'm looking high and low for a spot to download Windows Vista legally. It is
[laughably easy to download it illegally][1], and the download speed will be
better than Microsoft's servers anyway.

The next version of Windows should be freely available for download and the
installer should ask for my Windows Live ID, not some cryptic 5x5 product key.
