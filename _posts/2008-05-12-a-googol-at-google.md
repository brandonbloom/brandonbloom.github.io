Ok, well maybe not quite a Googol (1x10E^100), but certainly 2^63-1
(9,223,372,036,854,775,807).

Working at Google has irreversibly damaged my ability to reason about numbers.
One moment you are talking about petabytes of data and the next moment you are
talking about nanoseconds. It is truly mind numbing, but it has become hard not
to laugh when someone talks about a huuuuge dataset of a few gigabytes or a
*fast* process at a few seconds.
