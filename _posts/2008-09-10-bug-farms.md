I recently learnt a new [microspeak][1] phrase that I love: *bug farm*.

Some features are bug farms.

This means that these features are either poorly specified or highly
unmaintainable. As a result, they produce a larger than average portion of the
product's bugs. They can get into either state though a variety of ways, but by
far the most common way is insufficient thought during design or
implementation. Additionally, it is also possible to establish a bug farm by
building a feature on top of an existing bug farm.

If you encounter a feature which is covered in larvae, you should spray it with
insecticides immediately. It is better to use too much insecticide and kill the
feature than it is to deliver an infested product to your customers. That is,
if the bugs don't rise up and eat you before you get the chance to do either.
